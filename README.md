BANK CHURN ANALYSIS AND PREDICTION

Domain - Python And Machine Learning [ used EDA technique and machine learning algorithms for predictions]

Objective :- Identify factors contributing to customer churn and Utilize machine learning algorithms and predictive analytics to forecast potential churn, allowing proactive measures to be taken to prevent it.

About the Dataset :- The dataset has 12 columns

customer_id: This is the customers’ unique id which identifies them.

credit_score: this is the rating of the customer's credit Score.

country: This is the country the customer Come from.

estimated_ salary: This is the average annual salary received into the account.

churn: This field shows if the customer is still with the bank or not, represented by either 0 or 1 respectively

Keypoints about the Analysis :- ** Customers exhibiting low account activity are more predisposed with 64 % churn rate

** The churn rate among male customers that is 60% exceeds that of female customers

** The churn rate among adults is elevated with 65 % and then comes Seniors with 27 % . ** Credit card holders exhibit a higher churn rate with 69.91 %

** The churn rate remains unaffected by credit score, product numbers, and salary

** Tenure emerges as a significant factor influencing churn rate, as evidenced by boxplot analysis, with customers spending either more or less time with the bank exhibiting higher churn rates.

** The bank is experiencing customer attrition among those with substantial bank balances, which poses a potential impact on available capital for lending

** The accuracy rate of customer churn prediction is 80.45%
